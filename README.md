# Ghar-Ka-Khana
An end to end platform for providing food to the people living out of home from the local food providers.
It's a platform for students/professionals who're living outside for studies/job, they'll be connected with the lunch providers of their respective city. Where they can order and get it delivered home.
We've also made a provision for connecting delivery boys to kitchen owners who want to deliver their food to customers.
